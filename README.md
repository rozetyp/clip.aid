# ClipAid - Private AI Text Assistant

**Your text, your computer, your AI - Zero cloud, zero tracking, zero compromise.**

---

## üéØ What Is ClipAid?

ClipAid is a **privacy-first alternative to Grammarly** that improves your text using YOUR local AI instead of sending your data to someone else's cloud.

**The Problem with Grammarly:**
- ‚ùå Sends your text to their servers
- ‚ùå You don't know what they do with it
- ‚ùå Requires internet connection
- ‚ùå Closed-source (can't verify behavior)
- ‚ùå Subscription required

**ClipAid's Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Text stays on YOUR computer
- ‚úÖ Uses YOUR local AI (LM Studio, Ollama, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Works offline
- ‚úÖ Open source (898 lines you can read)
- ‚úÖ Free forever

2. **Single File:** No hidden DLLs or dependencies
3. **Network Monitor:** Use Wireshark - you'll see ONLY localhost traffic
4. **File Monitor:** Use Process Monitor - you'll see ONLY `ClipAid.config.json`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Popup says "‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot connect to AI server"**

**Fix:**
1. Check your local AI is running (LM Studio, Ollama, etc.)
2. Verify server is on port 1234 (or change ClipAid settings)
3. Try opening http://127.0.0.1:1234 in browser - should see API docs

### **Nothing happens when I copy text**

**Check:**
1. ClipAid icon in system tray? (may be hidden - click ^ arrow)
2. Copied at least 5 characters? (minimum requirement)
3. Copied less than 5000 characters? (maximum limit)
4. Waited 500ms after copying? (accidental copy filter)

### **Popup appears in wrong position**

**This is normal** - ClipAid positions popup near cursor but:
- Stays within screen bounds (20px margin)
- Won't overlap taskbar or screen edges
- If multi-monitor, appears on same screen as cursor

### **Want to disable for certain apps?**

Currently not supported, but workaround:
- Right-click tray icon ‚Üí Exit (when working with sensitive data)
- Re-run ClipAid when done

## üîß Advanced Usage

### **Build From Source**

Verify the code yourself:

```powershell
# Compile (requires .NET Framework 4.0 - built into Windows)
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe /target:winexe /out:ClipAid-Optimized.exe ClipAid-Pro.cs

# Your build should match provided .exe
```

### **Use With Different AI Models**

ClipAid works with ANY OpenAI-compatible API:
- LM Studio (local)
- Ollama (local)
- text-generation-webui (local)
- LocalAI (local)
- vLLM (local or remote)
- Even real OpenAI API (if you trust them with your data)

Just change endpoint in settings!

### **Multiple Configurations**

Want different settings for work vs personal?

1. Copy `ClipAid.config.json` to `ClipAid-Work.config.json`
2. Edit work config
3. Run ClipAid with: `ClipAid-Optimized.exe` (uses ClipAid.config.json)
